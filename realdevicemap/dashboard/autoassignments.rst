This is how RDM handles scheduling.

Add New Assignment
------------------
- :underline:`Select Target Device`: Choose which device you want to set a scheduled task for.
- :underline:`Select Destinaction Instance`: Choose which instance you want the device to run.
- :underline:`Time (Emtpy for "On Complete")`: What time (in 24 hour format) do you want the chosen device to run the chosen instance

    - On Complete could be used to auto switch to the \`On Complete\` Pokemon Circle task after the Auto Quest task is completed.
