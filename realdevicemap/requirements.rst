| RealDeviceMap can run anywhere and doesn't need to be run on MacOS. It doesn't even need to run in the same network, so you can run RDM on a VPN or similar.

* `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_  (and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose>`_ if not included already)
* At least one :doc:`../realdevicemapui/index` Device-Controller 
* (optional) Existing MySQL Database, or you can use the included database included in the docker.
