* `Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_  (and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose>`_ if not included already)

* At least one :doc:`../realdevicemapui/index` Device-Controller 

Note: RealDeviceMap can run everywhere and doesn't need to run on Mac. It doesn't even need to run in the same network. So you can run RDM on a VPN or similar.
